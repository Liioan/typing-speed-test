   lost my heart into that night before i lost myself the yellow light went through my eyes and then i felt embrace it wasn't dark but it was a guise hiding empty lights i lost my dyes into your black but first you've lost your heart this is endless war i don't have a gun it seems i'm blind sometimes i could be that guy sometimes i think i could fly and sometimes kiss for a while
